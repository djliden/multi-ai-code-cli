# Documentation Processor for Claude

I'll analyze **$1** and create focused reference documentation specifically for Claude to use effectively in this project context.

## Purpose

This creates practical reference docs that help Claude:
- Quickly understand how to use a library/service in this project
- Find relevant examples and patterns
- Navigate the official docs efficiently when needed
- Avoid common pitfalls

## Process

### 1. Content Analysis
I'll examine **$1** to understand:
- What technology/service this documents
- How it relates to Python CLI development
- Key concepts Claude needs to know

### 2. Smart Scoping
**For smaller docs**: Extract the most relevant patterns and examples
**For large docs**: Focus on navigation + the specific features you're likely to use

### 3. Create Focused References
I'll generate two complementary files in `/docs/`:

**`{library}-reference.md`** - Claude's quick reference:
- Essential concepts for this project context
- Common usage patterns and code examples
- Project-relevant gotchas and best practices

**`{library}-urls.md`** - Navigation guide:
- Key sections of the official documentation
- Direct links to frequently needed pages
- Search strategies and where to find specific topics

## Safeguards

If the URL contains non-documentation content (novels, irrelevant text), I'll confirm intent before proceeding.
